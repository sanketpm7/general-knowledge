### What is IT Rules 2021
- IT Rules are aimed at enhancing ***due diligence requirements*** and ensuring ***accountability of social media and other intermediaries***.
- These rules are framed under [[Section 87(2)]] of [[IT Act, 2000]].
-  These rules completely replace [[Information Technology (Amendment) Act 2008]]

### New Guidelines for SMIs:
1. [[Categorization of SMIs]]
	- Platform with <= 50 Lakh users = [[Social Media Intermediary]]
	- Platform with > 50 Lakh users = [[Significant Social Media Intermediary]]

2. Removing the immunity of [[Safe Harbour Provisions]]
	In case of negligence of Due diligence by platform then the [[Safe Harbour Provisions]] will no longer provide immunity to them

3. Grievance Readdressal Mechanism
	- SMIs shall appoint a [[Grievance Officer]] who shall register the grievance within 24 hours and resolve it in 15 days.

4. Removal of Content:
	- If there are complaints against the dignity of users, particularly women – about `exposed private parts of individuals` or `nudity` or `sexual act` or `impersonation` etc – social media platforms will be required to remove that **within 24 hours after a complaint is made**.
5. A monthly report 
	- SMI will have to publish a monthly report about the number of complaints received and the status of redressal.

6. Enabling Identity of the Originator
	- SMI will now have to provide the **first originator of the information**, if no such mechanism exists then they shall create to align with the rule

7. **Removal of Unlawful Information**
	- SMIs should not host or publish any information which is prohibited under any law.

8. [[For News Publishers on Digital Media]]
	  -  A three-level grievance redressal mechanism has been established under the rules with different levels of self-regulation.  
		1. **Level-I:** Self-regulation by the publishers;
		2. **Level-II:** Self-regulation by the self-regulating bodies of the publishers;
		3. **Level-III:** Oversight mechanism.

9. **[[For OTT]]:**  
	- **Self-Classification of Content:**
	    - The OTT platforms will self-classify the content into five age based **categories- :**
		    1. U (Universal), 
		    2. U/A 7+ 
		    3. U/A 13+ 
		    4. U/A 16+ 
		    5. A (Adult)
	- **Parental Lock:**  
	    - Platforms would be required to implement parental locks for content classified as U/A 13+ or higher, and reliable age verification mechanisms for content classified as “A”.
	- **Display Rating**
		- the classification rating specific to each content or programme together with a content descriptor
			
### **What happens in case of non compliance?**
- SMIs can be banned - if they don't comply with the rules
- SMIs lose `intermediary` status - and may become liable for criminal action

 **Examples of SMIs**
- [[Instagram]]
- [[YouTube]]
- [[WhatApp]]

### **What are the Concerns being raised?**

- Concerns have also been expressed over potential unavailability of ‘safe harbour’ protection given to intermediaries under Section 79 of the IT Act, under the new rules.

- They have requested a re-think over a clause in the new rules which can lead to imposition of criminal liability upon the employees for non-compliance by intermediaries, asking for it to be dropped in the interest of [[ease of doing business]].

- SMIs cannot provide **first originator of the information** of every message or content. Because this breaks end-to-end encryption and the privacy principles underlying it, and infringes upon users' fundamental rights to privacy and freedom of speech,"
