Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to look into the sub­categorisation of Scheduled Castes (SCs) to identify and help the most backward among them — a move that has been read as an attempt by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to woo the [[Madiga community]]. 

The Madigas are the most populous of all SC communities in the State but have claimed that their share of representation was being taken up by another SC community, the [[Malas]].

## Legality
**Case 1: Commission of Justice Ramachandra Raju, Andhra Pradesh [[1996]]**
Andhra Pradesh wanted to sub-categorize the communites in 1996.

The Supreme Court, in 2004, held that the State did not have the power to unilaterally sub­categorise communities in the list of SCs or Scheduled Tribes (STs). 

The Constitution has provided that these lists can only be made by Parliament and
notiﬁed by the President.


**Case 2: Justice Arun Mishra 2020 judgment**
Punjab wanted to subcategorize castes

The judgement said that deciding on the quantum of beneﬁts in the lists of SCs/STs already notiﬁed would not amount to “tinkering” with it and that States could do it. 

Given the contradiction, the 2020 judgement has also been referred to the larger Bench.

## Will Subcategorization help

Both the SC and ST Commissions have noted thatallotting separate reservations within the categories would not really address the root cause of the problem. 

In an internal note prepared by the NCST, it had explained that the most backward SCs are lagging so far behind forward SC communities that a separate quota would not help. 

It said that the idea was to ensure representation at all levels. But given the disparity, even if posts were reserved at higher levels, these most backward SCs would not have enough\ candidates to be considered for it in the ﬁrst place.

Both the NCSC and the NCST had thus recommended that existing schemes and government beneﬁts should ﬁrst reach these sections before any sub­categorisation.
