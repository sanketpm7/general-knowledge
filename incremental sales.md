Incremental sales are the additional units of a product that companies sell to retailers or consumers because of a sales promotion. When a sale is incremental, it's made by a customer who responded to a specific action, campaign or partner. These are sales that surpass the amount of products companies may have sold without the respective promotion. This means companies can use this KPI to determine how effective a specific marketing campaign was in boosting sales numbers.
