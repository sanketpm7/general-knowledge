## What is Delimitation
- Delimitation involves the process of redrawing the boundaries of electoral constituencies based on the most recent [[census]] data. 
- The objective is to ensure that each constituency has a roughly equal population, adhering to the principle of "[[one person, one vote]]."

## How is Delimitation carried out
- The [[Delimitation Commission]] is appointed by the **[[President of India]]**. and works in collaboration with the Election Commission of India to oversee this process.

- They use demographic data from the census to review and readjust constituency boundaries, taking into account changes in population distribution since the last delimitation exercise. The aim is to reflect shifts in population density and distribution and to maintain proportional representation.

- The Constitution **mandates that the Commission’s orders are final and cannot be questioned before any court**.

- When the orders of the Delimitation Commission are laid before the Lok Sabha or State Legislative Assembly, they cannot effect any modification in the orders.

## Delimitation carried on till now
Delimitation took place four times: 
- 1952
- 1963
- 1973
- 2002

## Why should Delimitation be carried out
- To provide equal representation to equal segments of a population.
- It is a fundamental aspect of the democratic electoral system and is often carried out periodically, usually after a national census, to account for demographic changes.
- To follow the principle of **“One Vote One Value”.**

## Concerns on Next Delimitation
- States which have performed well in reducing their population growth, such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala, may be punished.
- Disproportionate realignment of seats in parliament, Northern & Central state see > 50% increase in their seats while none of the Southern States have >15% increase in their representation
- 
## Way Forward
- First, the number of seats in Parliament needs to increase signiﬁcantly (at least around 848 seats to avoid any State losing seats),
- Delimitation should not be driven only by factors based on population. Geographical determinism, economic productivity, linguistic history, and a sense of fairness should also play a part.
