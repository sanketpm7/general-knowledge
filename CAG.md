Comptroller Auditor General of India

The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) is one of the most important institutions of the country to ensure public [[accountability]] of the [[executive]]. As the CAG’s work necessarily involves pointing out the irregularities, ineﬃciencies, leakages and corruption in our public ﬁnancial management system, relations between the governments and the CAG are generally adversarial.

CAG reports are known for their political neutrality, robustness of examination and objectivity of conclusions. They carry such high credibility with the public, that reports critical of the government generate widespread media and public attention and carry the potential to damage or destroy the government’s political capital — CAG reports on the Commonwealth Games, 2G, coal and other scams are still alive in public memory. In general, therefore, governments have reason to be wary about CAG reports.


### Way in which CAG can abuse his position 

- Holding up or delaying completed reports
- Tweaking approved audit plans
- Suspending ﬁled audits midway which is done only in unusual situations like the pandemic
- Transferring oﬃcers who have reportedly been involved with auditing sensitive government schemes.
