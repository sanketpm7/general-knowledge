[[poverty]] is often defined by one-dimensional measures – usually  based on income. But no single indicator can capture the multiple dimensions of poverty.

The problem with such an income-based definition is that it describes that person / community is poor but no why or how. The poor experience a range of disadvantages which keep them chained in poverty it is not just monetary aspect.

Multidimensional poverty measures can be used to create a more comprehensive picture. They reveal who is poor and how they are poor – the range of different disadvantages they experience.
