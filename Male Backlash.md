Economic theories regarding households suggest a [[negative correlation]], 
As a wife’s employment, especially when she earns more, means more income for the household. It is assumed to put the husband in a better position than without the wife’s income, thus reducing the occurrence of spousal violence. 

However, evidence from recent studies in India directly contradicts this theory. These studies show that employed women, particularly those earning more than their husbands, are at a higher risk of experiencing spousal violence. 

In sociology literature, this phenomenon is known as the presence of “male backlash”, wherein the challenge posed to traditional gender roles by women’s employment is sometimes reasserted by husbands through the use of violence.
