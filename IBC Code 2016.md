amended in 2019 due to COVID-19

The IBC, which came into existence in 2016, aimed to create a single, comprehensive framework that would provide a time-bound and cost-effective process for resolving insolvency and bankruptcy.

The IBC will be replacing a host of laws, with the aim to **streamline and speed up the resolution process of failed businesses.**

The Government implemented the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to consolidate all laws related to insolvency and bankruptcy and to tackle Non-Performing Assets (NPA), a problem that has been pulling the Indian economy down for years.

The Code is quite different from the earlier resolution systems as it shifts the responsibility to the creditor to initiate the insolvency resolution process against the corporate debtor.

Objectives of IBC:
- To consolidate and amend all existing insolvency laws in India.
- To simplify and speedup(expedite) the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Proceedings in India.
- To protect the interest of creditors and stakeholders in a company.
- To revive the company in a time-bound manner.
- To promote entrepreneurship.
- To get the necessary relief to the creditors and consequently increase the credit supply in the economy.
- To work out a new and timely recovery procedure to be adopted by the banks, financial institutions or individuals.
- To set up an Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India.
