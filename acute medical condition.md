Acute medical conditions often come on suddenly and can be severe in nature but are generally of a shorter duration compared to chronic conditions. 

Examples of acute conditions include the flu, a broken bone, a heart attack, or an acute infection. 

Acute conditions may require immediate medical attention and can often be resolved with appropriate and timely treatment.
