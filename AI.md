Artificial Intelligence
- refers to computer systems capable of performing complex tasks that historically only a human could do, such as reasoning, making decisions, or solving problems.

AI evolves in a non-linear way, AI is developed using [[ANN]] (artificial neural network) & they interaction evolves in a complex manner. so any change in one small node may cascade onto every other node in ways that cannot be monitored or controlled by humans.
