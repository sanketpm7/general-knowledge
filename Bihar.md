### Why is Bihar poor and backward?

- Bifurcation of state (Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar) led to shifting of industries to Jharkhand and created a dearth of employment and investment opportunities.

Natural causes:
- Lack of natural resources
- Lack of continuous water supply for irrigation
- Regular floods in northern part of state
- Severe droughts in southern part of state
