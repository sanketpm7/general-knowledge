- Governors do not have a unilateral veto over Bills passed by the legislature.

- The Governor was envisaged to be the Constitutional Head of a State.

- Every Bill passed in an Assembly has to be sent to the Governor ([[Article 200]]), after which he has four options â€” 
	1. To assent to the Bill
	2. Withhold assent
	3. Reserve the Bill for the consideration of the President
	4. Return the Bill to the legislature, asking it to reconsider the Bill or an aspect of it. The Governor can also suggest an amendment to the Bill. 

- The [[Sarkaria Commission]], headed by Justice R. S. Sarkaria, said in its [[1988]] report that it would not be desirable to appoint a Governor who is a member of the ruling party at the Centre, in a State where an Opposition party is governing. It said that the Governor appointee should be a detached outsider and a person of eminence in some walks of life.
