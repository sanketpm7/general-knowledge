### PIL
A [[Public Interest Litigation]] (PIL) was filed in the Supreme Court of India to challenge the constitutionality of Section 66A of the IT Act.

The PIL challenged that Section 66A IT Act, 2000 
*"trampled the [[Freedom of Speech and Expression]] guaranteed under [[Article 19(1)(a)]] of the [[Constitution of India]]."*

### Law:
- As per Section 66A, if offensive messages are sent through communication devices and computers, then it will be considered to be a crime.
- If the messages are grossly offensive, if the messages are meant to mislead or deceive the recipient, then it is punishable under the law.

### Issue:
- Ambiguity pertaining to the issue of “grossly offensive” as there were no guidelines about it.
- Arrests were made under Section 66(A) when unfavourable social media posts were directed against politicians and well-known personalities. Arrests were made on the grounds that the social media posts were offensive in nature.
- There were reports that disproportionate penalties were imposed and the law was misused.

### End result:
#### Supreme Court Judgement, 2015
- The Supreme Court of India observed that Section 66-A was over-broad and vague, hence it violated [Article 19(1)(a).](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/freedom-of-speech/)
- As this Section 66A IT Act violated the fundamental right of free speech, this law was struck down by the Supreme Court.
- A Two-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India. R.F. Nariman and J. Chelameshwar were the sitting judges.

This judgement was considered to be vital for the preservation of **[[online free speech]]** in India. This judgement was passed by the [[Supreme Court of India]].
