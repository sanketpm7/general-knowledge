### Effects on Health
**Directly:**
1. Causes more diseases
2. Causes more deaths

**Indirectly:**
1. affects nutrition
2. reduces working hours
3. increases climate-induced stress
4. [[Food Security]]

**Other:**
- Alter virulence of pathogens
- **Extended Warm Periods**
	- promote the proliferation of water and food­borne pathogens and diseases.
- Heat, physical exertion, and dehydration, a constant state for labourers, could lead to kidney injuries
- The risk of dying from [[pulmonary disease]] increases by 1.8–8.2% during a [[heat wave]] 
- Depression, aggravated by stress generated by the
change in weather conditions,
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder invariably accompany a climate emergency. These are rarely recognised in India, much less addressed.

### Effects on India
Urban areas, not tempered by urban greenery and open spaces and ﬁlled with asphalt roads and [[heat ­retaining buildings]] that physically block air circulation, bear the worst ill eﬀects of climate change due to the [[urban heat island eﬀect]]. (Urban areas are warmer than surrounding rural areas, especially at night).

Climate change puts further pressure on the weak urban primary health system, already suﬀering he ill eﬀects of air pollution; urban planning that discourages physical activity; and work-­related and cultural stress.

**How to tackle them in India:**
- better urban planning, 
- increasing green cover, 
- water conservation, 
- public health interventions

#### Climate Emergencies
1. [[Extreme Heat]]
2. [[Cyclones]]
3. [[Floods]]
4. [[Drought]]

### Important Bodies
COP28: 
	Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28)
