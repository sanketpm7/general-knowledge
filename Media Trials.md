Media Trial or Trial by media 

```
The Media is running agenda-driven debates and Kangaroo Courts, which is not healthy for democracy.

- CJI N V Ramana
```

It describes the impact of television and newspaper coverage on an issue by creating a widespread perception of guilt/innocence before, or after, a verdict in a court.

#### Can the media houses do this, is this illegal or harmful?
- Yes it is harmful but they provided the freedom to do so by the [[constitution]]
- [[Article 19]] - Freedom of Speech

##### Affects of Media Trails
1. Affects perception of the issue by running [[agenda driven campaigns]] 
2. Affects judicial trajectory when the media decides to campaign against [[judges]]
 2. [[Wrongful portrayal]] of issue or person in questions
 3. Can instigate Hatred and violence in worst case even [[riots]] or [[civil unrest]]
 4. [[Right to privacy]] comes  

#### Can the Media trail be kept in check, How is Media regulated in India?

[[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]] and [[Prasar Bharti]] regulate & govern the media & entertainment sector.

Laws:

Way Forward
- Media should act responsibly and not misuse the Right to Freedom
- Should be careful not to create bias or incite the masses
- Media should only present well researched issues, and not act as a pseudo-judiciary, we have judiciary for this purpose
- Media should become socially responsible & maintain its credibility
- Media should follow [[objective journalism]]
