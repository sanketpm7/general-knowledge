#### What is PLI?
The ‘Production Linked Initiative’ (**PLI**) scheme offers companies incentives on [[incremental sales]] from products manufactured in India. 

It aims to attract foreign companies to set up units in India while encouraging local companies to expand their manufacturing units, generate more employment, and reduce the country's reliance on imports.

In PLI Scheme, **Domestic and Foreign companies** receive financial rewards for **manufacturing in India**, based on a percentage of their revenue over up to five years.

#### Objectives:
- Promote domestic manufacturing by offering production incentives and encouraging capital investments
- Attract core knowledge competency and cutting-edge technologies
- Promote job generation and employment
- Construct district-level export hubs
- Improve ease of doing business
- Cut down logistics costs
- Boost domestic manufacturing output in five years

In general incentives given will be calculated on the basis of sales, performance and local value addition done over the period of five years
#### Successes
**Smartphone Manufacturing:**
   - In FY 2017-18, mobile phone 
	   - imports: $3.6 billion 
	   - exports: $334 million 
	   - trade deficit: $ (-)3.3 billion
   - By FY 2022-23, 
	   - imports: $1.6 billion
	   - exports: $11 billion 
	   - trade surplus: $(+)9.8 billion
#### Challenges
- There is no common set of parameters to understand the value added by companies that have received or are likely to receive incentives under the scheme.
- According to the research, the industries think that further incentives are required to make India more appealing than China and Vietnam.
- Country lack in creating a centralised database to monitor progress.
- Vague Disbursal of Incentives there is no well-defined criteria or standardised parameters that ministries and departments use to **determine the allocation of these incentives,** raising concerns about the fairness and effectiveness of the scheme.
- Assembly vs. Value Addition:
	- Success of mobile phone manufacture come with a twist, we are producing phones and exporting them much of what goes into phones is still being imported.

#### Way forward
- The government must assess PLI's effectiveness
- Extending the scheme to new sectors requires understanding its limitations and addressing underlying issues.
