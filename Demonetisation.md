"Demonetization" means when a government decides to invalidate or replace its currency with new notes.

**[[The High Denomination Bank Notes (Demonetisation) Act, 1978]]**
	- withdrawing Rs 1000, Rs 5000, and Rs 10,000 notes that were in circulation
	- [[Morarji Desai]] was PM of India when this [[ordinance]] was introduced 

**Demonetisation in [[2016-November-8]]**
	- demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes
	- PM: [[Narendra Modi]]

**Why did the government do the Demonetisation?**
```
… on the one hand is the problem of terrorism, on the other is the challenges posed by corruption and black money.

- Narendra Modi
```
 The big bet in demonetising is to break the unholy nexus of corruption, black money and terrorism.

Effects of demonetisation on:
a. **Terrorism**
- They mainly uses counterfeit currency to fund their activities 
- Government has issued new currency, hence the old technology used by terrorists to print money will be outdated, they cannot print the new currency 

Demonetisation & issuing of new currency for a short period of time tackled this counterfeit currency issue, until the anti-nationals develop a technology to print newly issued currency.

b. **Black Money and Corruption**
How is [[black money]] accumulated.
  Black money is accumulated through different sources. The three main sources of black money are 
	  1. [[corruption]]
	  2. [[hawala]]
	  3. [[crime]]. 
  Among these, corruption is the chief villain.

Demonetisation was not successful in curtailing black money since major chunk of black money is invested with financial institutions outside the country.

People who have black money have found ways to keep it in banks or other financial setups in other nations, so when the government invalidates the local currency, it doesn't affect that money stashed abroad. Therefore, the effort to curb black money within the country might not reach the funds hidden in foreign financial systems.

Black money utilised to buy assets like gold, property, business were not affected by demonetisation.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, the demonetisation cannot be categorised into successful or not-successful tags since it had it's successes & failure w.r.t to its targets.
