The Finance Commissions are commissions periodically constituted by the [[President of India]] under [[Article 280]] of the [[Constitution of India | Indian Constitution]] to define the financial relations between the **central government** and the [individual state governments].

As per the constitution, the commission is appointed every five years and consists of a chairman and four other members.

# History / Why is FC needed
As a federal nation, India suffers from both vertical and horizontal [[fiscal imbalances]].

Vertical imbalances between the central and state governments result from states incurring expenditures disproportionate to their sources of [[revenue]], in the process of fulfilling their responsibilities

Horizontal imbalances among state governments result from differing historical backgrounds or resource endowments and can widen over time

# Functions
1. Distribution of '**[[net proceeds]]'** of taxes **between Center and the States,** to be divided as per their respective contributions to the taxes.
2. Determine factors governing Grants-in-Aid to the states and the magnitude of the same.
3. **To make recommendations to the president** as to the measures needed to augment the Fund of a State to **supplement the resources of the panchayats and municipalities in the state** on the basis of the recommendations made by the finance commission of the state.
4. Any other matter related to it by the president in the interest of sound finance.

# 5th FC

# 14th FC
1. Raise the stateâ€™s share of tax receipts from 32% to 42%, which has been in place since 2015. (This would help to close the resource gap in each state.)

**Other advices**
With the exception of the Northeastern region and three hill states, the [[Special Category Status]] for states has been abolished by the 14th Finance Commission.
