It is an extension of [[Public Infrastructure]]

Digital public infrastructure (DPI) refers to blocks or **platforms such as digital identification, payment infrastructure and data exchange solutions** that help countries deliver essential services to their people, empowering citizens and improving lives by enabling digital inclusion.

- DPIs mediate the flow of people, money and information.
	- First, the flow of people through a digital ID System. 
	- Second, the flow of money through a real-time fast payment system. 
	- Third, the **flow of personal information through a consent-based data** sharing system.

Foundational DPIs:
1. Digital Identification
2. Immediate Payment Service
3. Data Sharing solutions

Every country needs these foundational DPI solutions to build an effective DPI.

India became the first country to develop all 3 foundational DPI:
1. [[Aadhar]] - Digital Identification
2. [[UPI]] - Digital Payment System (Real-time)
3. Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture ([[DEPA]]) - Data Sharing solution
