The ‘purple sector’—purple being the
colour of disability—represents a work-
force that includes not only persons
with disabilities, but also special educa-
tors, rehabilitation experts, healthcare
personnel, and entrepreneurs and
innovators catering to products and
services for special needs. In other
words, it’s a large and highly frag-
mented sector.
