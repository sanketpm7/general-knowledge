State: Uttarakhand

This region is called IHR: Indian Himalayan Region

The [[Flash Floods 2013]] in Uttarakhand are suggested as the reason for the construction of Char Dham Project

Linking four religious pilgrimages:
1. [[Gangotri]]
2. [[Yamunotri]]
3. [[Badrinath]]
4. [[Kedarnath]]

Problems:
**Carrying Capacity on IHR:**
The IHR region is in still in the transformative phase.

- No clear research on Carrying Capacity of IHR
- No clear research on Carrying Capacity of all the other Infrastructure projects in the region:
	- How many hydropower projects can the region sustain?
	- How much tourism?
	- How many roads?
	- How much road-widening should be allowed?
	- How much cutting of mountains & dumping of debris in water?
