## What is SCS(State Category Status)

It is **a classification given by the Centre to assist development of states that face geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.**

> There no SCS provision under the Constitution

The SCS was introducted in [[1969]] on recommendation of [[Finance Commission#Fifth FC| 5th Finance Commission]]

## Factors considered for granting SCS:
1. Hilly Region or difficult terrain
2. Low Population Density and/or sizeable share of Tribal population
3. Location along international borders
4. Economic and Infrastructure Backwardness
5. Non viable nature of state finances
((5) -> mismanagement of resources, excessive debt burden, lack of industrial development, or other structural issues. Financial condition of a state is not sustainable or robust enough to meet its obligations and fund its essential functions) )

## Benefits of SCS
1. The ratio of expenditure on all centrally-sponsored schemes between Centre-State is 90:10. The central government bears 90% of the state expenditure while rest 10% is borne by the State or given as loan with 0% rate of interest.
2. Preferential treatment in getting central funds, i.e., SCS get a higher % in grants from the central govt. for similar kind of projects.
3. Reduction on [[Excise duty]] to attract industries to the state.
4. 30% of the Centre’s gross budget also goes to special category states.
5. These states can avail the benefit of debt-swapping and debt relief schemes.
6. States with SCS are exempted from customs duty, corporate tax, income tax and other taxes to attract investment.
7. Special category states have the facility that if they have unspent money in a financial year; it does not lapse and gets carry forward for the next financial year.

## States that want SCS
**Bihar**:
Reason: [[Bihar#Why is Bihar poor and backward?| Why Bihar is poor & backward]]

**Andha Pradesh**
Since bifurcation in [[2014]], AP has asked for a grant of SCS on the grounds of revenue loss due to Hyderabad going to [[Telangana]].

**Odisha**
Vulnerability to natural calamities such as cyclones and large tribal population (nearly 22%)

## Concerns


## Conclusion
With the exception of the Northeastern region and three hill states, the “special category status” for states has been abolished by the [[Finance Commission#14th FC|14th Finance Commission]].

Instead, it advised the Centre to raise the state’s share of tax receipts from 32% to 42%, which has been in place since 2015. This would help to close the resource gap in each state.

- Yes, since it meets most of the criteria. But considering Bihar's population 90:10 funding ratio on centrally-sponsored-schemes will be burden to the funds.
