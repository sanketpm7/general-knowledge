A recursively 'self-improving' AI that improves beyond the beyond Human Control.
An with the ability to improve itself without any human input.

Problems?
Imagine you have set certain rules to AI regarding morals, ethics, human welfare etc. but the self-improving AI may arrive at a conclusion that the rules set by are not optimal.

e.g.:
Rule 1: Work hours should be 8-9 hours per day.
- AI consider this rule to against the economy & demands humans to work all the time leaving out time only eat-sleep-rave. If AI rules are to be imposed then this will cause unimaginable problems.
