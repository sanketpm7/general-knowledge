As a result of climate change, traditional farming practices are becoming less productive.

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] said in [[2019]]: 
Climate-­smart agriculture is an approach for transforming food and agriculture systems to support sustainable development and safeguard food security under climate change. CSA comprises three pillars or objectives: 
1. sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes; 
2. adapt and build resilience to climate change; 
3. reduce/remove GHG (greenhouse gases) emissions, where possible. 

Dimensions of climate­smart practices include water-­smart, weather-­smart, energy-smart, and carbon-­smart practices. They improve productivity, deal with land degradation, and improve soil health.
