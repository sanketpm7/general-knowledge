The pancreas is a [[gland]] located behind the stomach, and it plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood sugar (glucose) levels.

When you eat, especially when you consume carbohydrates, your blood sugar levels rise. In response to this, the pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream.

Insulin acts as a key that allows cells in the body, particularly muscle, fat, and liver cells, to take up [[glucose]] from the blood and use it for energy. This process helps to lower blood sugar levels. In addition to its role in glucose metabolism, insulin also plays a role in the storage of excess glucose in the liver and muscles for later use.

[[Insulin]] is a [[hormone]] produced by the [[beta cells]] in the pancreas
