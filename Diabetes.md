Diabetes is a [[chronic medical condition]] that occurs when the body is unable to properly regulate blood sugar ([[glucose]]) levels. Glucose is a vital source of energy for cells, and its levels in the blood are normally controlled by the hormone [[insulin]], which is produced by the [[pancreas]].


### Type 1 Diabetes
 - Less common, but not rare
 - This occurs when the [[immune system]] mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. 
 - As a result, the body produces little to no insulin.
 - People with type 1 diabetes require [[insulin injections]] or an [[insulin pump]] to manage their blood sugar levels.

### Type 2 Diabetes
- This is more common
- This occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin to meet the body's needs. 
- It is caused lifestyle factors:
	- [[poor diet]]
	- lack of physical activity 
	- obesity. 
- It can sometimes be managed with lifestyle changes, oral medications, or insulin.
