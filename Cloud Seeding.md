Process:
- Fly an aircraft into rain cloud 
- Sprinkle a proprietary salt solution on them
- Salts will interact with water droplets in the cloud and make them heavier
- The heavier drops will eventually condense as rain

Solapur, Maharastra
- First experiment of cloud seeding was carried out here
- over two [[monsoons]] in [[2018]], [[2019]]
- results: 18% more rainfall (about 8.67 mm more)

Why was Solapur chosen?
- [[rain shadow region]] - this region receives very little rain

Not all clouds are seedable, not all clouds make rain. There are cloud that will disspate on seeding


Challenges:
1. Some of rain from seeded cloud drifted several kms beyond the marked area
