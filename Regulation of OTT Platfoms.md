July-2023, [[TRAI]] at the request of GoI reviewed whether there is a need to regulate the [[OTT]] platforms.

***Pushed from the Telecoms company side***

#### [[Telecom Companies]] Argument:
 Traditional revenue streams such as SMS, Voice Calls have come under pressure due the rise of OTT services which are free.
 e.g.: [[WhatApp]] - Free Voice Call, Free Video Call & Free messaging service

 Due to such OTT services there is the Telecom companies are under a constant stress to upgrade the existing infrastructure to handle internet traffic, this up-gradation is not guaranteeing them a rise in revenue.

 They're arguing that OTT services are not subject to the same level of taxation and licensing fees.

#### **Counter Argument.**

 There rise the internet-traffic is mainly due to the OTT Services, nobody would be interested to spend money on internet without the lucrative allure of the OTT services. Most of us want to access these services such as [[YouTube]], [[WhatsApp]], Wikipedia etc hence we pay the [[ISP]] (Internet Service Providers (Telecom Companies)) to provide us that, this surge in demand is benefiting the Telecom Companies.

 OTT Services face their own unique challenges, since their competition field lies on a layer above this abstraction of internet-access, where these services need to fight with other services to maintain their Quality. 

 For eg.: Video streaming services such as YouTube run the servers (which are very costly) to provide the quality to the customers.

 This demand of telecom companies is against the principles of [[Net Neutrality]]
